# Flashing the firmware
You can download the latest firmware from the [release](https://github.com/stanvn/zigbee-plant-sensor/releases) page. 

The nRF52840 microcontroller uses SWD for programming, so basically any programming supporting SWD can be used to flash the firmware. I recommend using a [J-Link edu mini](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3571) or a [nRF52840 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dk)

>**Note:** Some nRF modules ship with a ready-only flash. This is no problem for a J-Link (or nRF52840 DK) but it can lead to problems when you are using a ST-Link (V2)


## B-Parasite connection
To program the B-Parasite you can either solder wires to the programming pins or use a [6-pin pogo clamp](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003667993025.html?pdp_npi=2%40dis%21EUR%21€%2011%2C28%21€%208%2C45%21%21%21%21%21%40211b423c16668977269877020ef735%2112000026719919447%21btf&_t=pvid:bf1f0be6-8bd6-4cfb-a538-c67a0824794a&afTraceInfo=1005003667993025__pc__c_ppc_item_bridge__xxxxxx__1666897727&spm=a2g0o.ppclist.product.mainProduct) as shown in the image below.

> **IMPORTANT: always remove the battery before you connect the programmer**

Next connect the pins to the programmer as follows:

| B-Parasite | Programmer |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Vcc        | +3.3V      |
| GND        | GND        |
| RST        | RST        |
| IO         | SWDIO      |
| CLK        | SWDCLK     |

## Programming using J-Link or nRF52840 DK
The nRF52840 can be used as a J-Link programmer if you connect it like this:
![nrf52 DK Connection](https://github.dev/stanvn/zigbee-plant-sensor/blob/main/docs/images/nrf52-dk-connection.png)

For other J-Links use the connections table above.

Once the programmer is connected and you have downloaded the .hex file from the [release](https://github.com/stanvn/zigbee-plant-sensor/releases) page, you can flash the file onto the microcontroller using [nRF Connect Programmer](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=/struct_nrftools/struct/nrftools_nrfconnect.html). There documentation describes in details how to flash the hex file.

## Programming using ST-LINK
Flashing to the nRF52840 can also be achieved with other programmers like ST-LINK but this is not possible using Nordicsemi's software.

### Prepare for flashing:
- Download the .hex file from the [release](https://github.com/stanvn/zigbee-plant-sensor/releases) page
- Make sure your [ST-LINK driver](https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST/wiki/ST-Link-Driver) is correctly installed
- Make sure you have a tool with which you can open telnet connections (e.g. [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/putty)/[KiTTY](https://9bis.net/kitty/))
- Download and install  [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/pages/getting-openocd.html)
- Open the "bin" folder of your OpenOCD installation and create a file called "openocd_nrf52.cfg" with the following content:
```
#
# Nordic Semiconductor NRF52 Development Kit (nRF52832)
#
source [find interface/stlink.cfg]

transport select hla_swd

source [find target/nrf52.cfg]
```

### Flashing
- Connect the board to the programmer and the programmer to the PC
- Run OpenOCD using `openocd -d2 -f openocd_nrf52.cfg`
- OpenOCD should now state that it is listening to some ports including 4444 for telnet
- Connect to port 4444 via telnet (e.g. with [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/putty) or [KiTTY](https://9bis.net/kitty/)) and execute the following set of commands replacing the path with the appropriate full path to the downloaded hex file
```
reset init
reset halt
nrf51 mass_erase
set WORKAREASIZE 0x4000
program C:/path/to/hex/file/zigbee-plant-sensor-vXX.hex verify
reset run
exit
```
- Disconnect everything and enjoy your newly flashed zigbee plant sensor!

## Programming using Raspberry Pi

Compile and install OpenOCD from this fixed branch of a RPi SPI version of OpenOCD:

`git clone https://github.com/Zorvalt/openocd-spi/ --branch fix-multiple-gcc-10-errors`  
See this issue: https://github.com/lupyuen/openocd-spi/issues/6
```
apt install build-essential libtool libhidapi-dev netcat
cd openocd-spi
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-sysfsgpio --enable-bcm2835spi --enable-cmsis-dap
make
```

Connect pins according to this Pi pinout: https://www.pcbway.com/blog/technology/OpenOCD_on_Raspberry_Pi__Better_with_SWD_on_SPI.html

Create a `swd-pi-ocd` with the following contents:

```
# Select the Broadcom SPI interface for Raspberry Pi (SWD transport)
interface bcm2835spi

# Set the SPI speed in kHz
bcm2835spi_speed 31200  # 31.2 MHz

# Select nRF52 as target
source [find target/nrf52.cfg]
```

Start openocd:

`src/openocd -s tcl -f swd-pi.ocd -d2`

You can then connect to OpenOCD in a new terminal with `nc localhost 4444`.

Download the hex file on your Pi and follow the telnet flashing instructions similar to the ST-Link above.
